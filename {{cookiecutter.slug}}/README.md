## Development

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for dependency management. Make sure [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) is installed (e.g., `brew install pipx` on Mac) and then install poetry with `pipx install poetry`.

Once that's set up, you can install the project dependencies and run various tasks via [`poe`](https://poethepoet.natn.io/poetry_plugin.html) or `poetry run`. You can view all of the available tasks by running `poetry run poe --help` or reviewing the `[tool.poe.tasks]` of the `pyproject.toml` file.

```sh
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Make sure git is initialized, if not already
git init

# Setup pre-commit and pre-push hooks
poetry run poe pre-commit

# Run linters
poetry run poe lint

# Run tests
poetry run poe test
poetry run poe coverage
# Or
poetry run pytest

# Build the package
poetry build
```
